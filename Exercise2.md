1. Data Cleaning, Standardization & Preprocessing

 Cleaning & De-duplication
 
Duplicates were prevented at the scraping stage using job_url uniqueness.
 
Post-scraping: .drop_duplicates(subset=["job_url"]) can be applied to Pandas for added assurance.

Strip whitespace and unwanted characters from text fields.

Handling Missing Values

Fields like salary are sometimes missing and marked as "N/A" when scraping.

Replace "N/A" with NaN in post-processing for ML compatibility.

Normalize empty strings and invalid values to ensure consistency.
Normalize relative dates ("2d ago" → 2023-10-01)	dateparser library

2. Machine Learning Preparation
Tokenization: spacy (preserves tech terms like "C#")

Feature Engineering

Feature	Processing
Company	Target encoding (by average salary)
Location	Geocoding → (lat, lon) + k-means clustering
Salary	Log-transform for normalization
Job Title	Entity extraction (Senior/Junior)


3. Optimizing the Scraper for Scale
   
Headless Browsing                 Reduces resource usage, improves speed
Pagination via URL                Avoids fragile UI navigation
Deduplication Cache               In-memory or Redis-based duplicate tracking
Incremental Scraping:             Only scrape new jobs since the last scrape
API-based Scraping                 Switch to public job APIs if available

4. Long-Term Efficiency & Maintenance
   
Schedule scraper using cron jobs, Airflow, or Prefect.
Store backups of raw HTML or data in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3).
Use Docker for consistent and portable deployment.
Add logging and error tracking for monitoring (e.g., ELK stack).

Justification for the Plan
Clean, structured data is essential for accurate analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
Standardizing and encoding textual and categorical data ensures compatibility with ML models.
Efficiency improvements like headless scraping and pagination via URL greatly reduce resource usage.
Scalability strategies like parallel processing and caching make the scraper production-ready.
This plan supports ML use cases such as job recommendation engines, salary prediction, or clustering.
